# User Manual - Tourney Manager App

**Author**: Team 09

The code for the Tourney Manager app can be found in the `TourneyManager` folder inside the `GroupProject` folder. The app is just the beta version of the final app that will be delivered on March 10th 2017. As such, the user interface of the application is almost ready but the final tocuhes have to be completed.
 
The database classes to store the Tournament info, Player info and Match info is also complete. The core logic of the app to generate the tournament, end the tournament, generate the matches and rounds are also complete. However, the integration of the db classes with the app is yet to be completed.

The app is currently tested with some mock data, and the integration with the database classes will happen in the final phase.

To run the app, take the `TourneyManager` package and run it in a android emulator or any device. The app creates a SQLite database called `tourneydb` in the execution environment to store the data.
