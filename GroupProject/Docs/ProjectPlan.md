# Project Plan

**Author**: Team 09

## Introduction

The project is an Android application that offers as a management tool for a tournament. Players of the tournament are also able to view the information.

## Process Description

1. Develop Use Case Scenarios
	- This should describe the methods in which the app is used by its users. This document should visually represent the flow of the process
	- Entrant Criteria: A good understanding of the requirement documents
	- Exit Criteria: This should be used as a basis for system design in the design documents
2. Create Design Document
	- The document should describe the design of the system. This should include UI mock-ups, architecture, and class diagrams.
	- Entrant Criteria: A good understanding of the requirements document and use case scenarios.
	- Exit Criteria: This should yield the overall system design and provide a path for implementation by the team.
3. Outline Testing and QA procedures
	- This should outline the procedures for testing and QA. This should define inputs into the system and expected outputs. This procedure should be automated as much as possible.
	- Entrant Criteria: System design, what the expected uses are, and the expected outputs of those cases.
	- Exit Criteria: Clear understanding of test procedure.
4. Design Database
	- A database structure should be decided on and used. (SQL, Mongo, etc.). The database is the central part of the system and needs to be designed and implemented first. All other classes used in this application should query or set items through the database. The database should be stored in a cloud service so that each user device can retrieve the same information.
	- Entrant Criteria: Database selection and experience in setting up the database.
	- Exit Criteria: The database should be implemented to be robust and dependable.
5. Create Android Activities
	- Create the Activities used for user interface of the App. These activities should use and call the implemented classes per the design document.
	- Entrant Criteria: Understanding of system design.
	- Exit Criteria: Implementations of the UI elements separate from the classes that do the work.
6. Create Working classes
	- These classes should be created and implemented per the design document. The UI elements will call these methods to do the requested work. These classes will also interact with the database object to perform these actions.
	- Entrant Criteria: Understanding of the design document, implemented UI elements, and an implemented Database.
	- Exit Criteria: Working classes that adequately handle the requested actions.
